<h1>Webpage Plan:</h1>
<p> What I ranked in my ranking assignment was pictures of flowers, I looked up pictures of flowers in the internet, and chose the ones I found prettiest and put them higher on the ranking. For the bottom flower, I looked up "weird flowers" but they were still good-looking so I clicked a random one and chose for it to be the "ugliest" one out of all. </p>
